All about the 100 pixel punks inscribed on the bitcoin (classic) blockchain in the (binary) image/png format - 8-bit colors (in r/g/b with alpha channel); 24×24 with 8x zoom, that is, 192×192 pixels.

Q: Who is the creator?

Flow Stay is the creator of Ordinal Punks.

Q: Who is Flow Stay?

Flow Stay is the anonymous discord (chat) handle
of the Ordinal Punks creator
and likely the creator of the official website
and twitter page & posts.

As of February 14th, 2023 Flow Stay is still posting
(and hasn't yet disappeared Sathosi-like forever).

If you know more, please tell / share!



Q: How are punk (pixel art) images generated?

Note / Disclaimer:  I (Gerald Bauer) am the creator of the punk's not dead text-to-image generation algorithm  (& [punk spritesheet](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.spritesheet)) BUT
have heard about Ordinal Punks in the news and
I have no insight knowledge and
I am NOT affiliated with Ordinal Punks (HODLing: 0).


Anyways,
to give you an idea on how-to-use
the punk (open source) algorithm / machinery
I have put together [**100 Ordinal Punks - The Free White Label Quick Starter Edition**](../ordinalpunks) - Yes, you can. Let's (re)create from zero / scratch a pixel-perfect
copy of the Ordinal Punks collection (Anno 2023) using text prompts ("attributes").

Triva / Errata:   While preparing [**100 Ordinal Punks - The Free White Label Quick Starter Edition**](../ordinalpunks/)
I found two bugs / errors in the official metadata:

- ![](i/25.png) Ordinal Punk #25  - Incl. An Extra Hoodie
    >     "attributes": [{"trait_type": "Type",   "value": "Male 2"},
    >                    {"trait_type": "Hair",   "value": "Sombrero"},
    >                    {"trait_type": "Mouth",  "value": "Mustache"},

- ![](i/84.png) Ordinal Punk #84  - The (Punk) Type Reads:  Alien Male Green BUT is really (Human) Male 1
    >     "attributes": [{"trait_type": "Type", "value": "Male Alien Green"},
    >                    {"trait_type": "Eyes", "value": "Eye Mask"},

    >                    {"trait_type": "Hair", "value": "Fedora Black & White"}]



Bonus:  For your convenience I have reformated
the dataset in javascript notation (.json)
into the tabular dataset in the comma-separated values (.csv) format.
The [**ordinalpunks.csv**](../ordinalpunks/ordinalpunks.csv) dataset (with 100 records / rows) reads:

``` csv
id,  type,  gender, skin_tone,  count, accessories
1,  Robot,   Male,,       1,  Big Beard
2,  Human,   Male,    2,  2,  Bubble Gum / Birthday Hat
3,  Human,   Female,  1,  3,  Flowers / Frown / Gold Chain
4,  Demon,   Male,,       2,  Hoodie / Pipe
5,  Ape,     Male, Blue,  2,  Buck Teeth / Cowboy Hat
6,  Human,   Male,    3,  2,  Laser Eyes / Cowboy Hat B & W
7,  Human,   Male,    1,  1,  Cap Burger King
8,  Vampire, Male,,       1,  Demon Horns
