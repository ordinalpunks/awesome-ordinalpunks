## Ordinal Punks "Road Map" Update - What's Next? - More Official or Unofficial Ordinal Punks Upcoming?


>  Eventually there will be more opportunity for people to join the [ordinal punks] community.
> As I said before, I will be doing stuff like gen art etc on Bitcoin in the future
> (ordinal punks gonna get it all free).
> However there won't be any more ordinal punks and that's not something I intend to do.
> For now though my main priority is getting the fee-less marketplace out for ordinal punks
so holders can trade their holdings easily (punk ethos).
>
> After that is all out and polished up, I will start focusing on some of that stuff.
>
> There has been some people in the community doing cool stuff with the punk's not dead algorithm as well.
> @Xen0ph0n.eth  with H00d [Hoodie Gang] and
> @ZimmerAllDay  doing some cool Neo [Neon Electric Ordinal Punks] versions for Ordinal Punks.
